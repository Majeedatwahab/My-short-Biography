        <h2>A short biography</h2>
        <p class="biography">
          My name is Majeedat, but you can call me MJ. i am a 24year old Muslim woman from Kwara state currently residing in Kaduna state. I did not realize writing a biography of myself would be this hard so here is a list of things about me; 
<ul>
  <li>I love Allah S.W.T(God) and i love everything about my religion.</li>
  <li>i can crochet literally anything(do not ask me for proof though).</li>
  <li>I silently correct peoples grammar mistake.</li>
  <li>I think i might be obsessed with making sure everything is in order.</li>
  <li>I love cooking.</li>
  <li>I hate fried egg because it makes me want to puke my guts out.</li>
  <li>I am excellent team player</li>
  <li>I am starting to fall in love with Frontend engineering.</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Reason for joining Altschool Africa</h2>
        <p>
          Permit me to be a bio-nerd for a little bit. 
 Antibiotic resistance happens when germs like bacteria develop the ability to fight the drugs designed to kill them.
That means instead of being killed, the germs continue to grow, unharmed. Resistant infections can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat leading to about 700,000 deaths per year globally.
A major cause of antibiotic resistance is the misuse and abuse of antibiotics.
Now how does Altschool come in to play:
I want to be able to build world class websites and web applications that will aid in solving the problems of antibiotic resistance, basically build softwares, biosoftwares, if you may, that would help to make the healthcare system a better one.
I believe Altschool Africa would help me to become a world class engineer.</p>
<p>How can you as an individual help stop antibiotic resistance?
Stop the unprescribed and frequent use of antibiotics.
